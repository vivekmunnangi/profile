        <p>
            I joined the team in <strong>August 2024</strong>, about seven months into development, shortly after
            IU Luddy Racing announced its participation in the <strong>Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC)</strong>.
            My focus was on <strong>state estimation and vehicle dynamics</strong>, working alongside the
            controller and localization leads to solve state-related problems and refine the dynamics model.
        </p>

        <p>
            After onboarding, I identified the need for a more advanced dynamics model and proposed a
            <strong>grip prediction module</strong> to estimate traction limits. This allowed us to design
            safer, more aggressive <strong>velocity profiles</strong> using offline planners. I also analyzed
            <strong>engine performance data</strong>, building strategies for <strong>optimal gear shifting</strong>
            based on ECU and dynamometer data to adapt power delivery to track demands.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our first dynamic module control tests took place at <strong>Las Vegas Motor Speedway (LVMS) in January 2025</strong>,
            showing promising results. Over the next months, we prepared for <strong>multi-car racing</strong>, updating the
            stack for robustness and safety. In <strong>July 2025</strong>, we competed at <strong>Laguna Seca Raceway</strong>
            against eight international teams. Despite a late practice crash that forced speed adjustments,
            we achieved <strong>4th place overall</strong> – a strong showing for our first-ever road course race
            and only our third competition as a new team.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            These milestones gave us valuable data on vehicle dynamics, localization, and controller behavior.
            Going forward, I continue developing new modules to push performance and safety, helping
            IU Luddy Racing compete at the cutting edge of autonomous motorsport.

    <p>Co-founded and developed a unified dental platform with real-time ETL pipelines and a fine-tuned AI agent for actionable practice insights.</p>

    <div class="full-content">
        <h3>AI Head, DentalMatrix.ai</h3>

        <p>
            At DentalMatrix.ai, we built a platform to help dental clinics unify their patient and lead data. 
            Clinics often manage patient records in OpenDental and track new inquiries in GoHighLevel CRM. 
            Our solution integrates these systems into a single database, allowing clinics to track existing patients 
            and potential leads in one place. This unified data enables clinics to target marketing campaigns, convert 
            potential patients into real appointments, and improve overall operational efficiency. So with this I started working on sync operations using API on <strong>September 2024</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            We also developed a domain-specific <strong>AI Agent</strong> to interact with clinic staff. Unlike generic 
            chatbots, this agent is fine-tuned on dental terminology, CRM data structures, and official dental abbreviations. 
            It provides answers to natural-language questions with either <strong>textual explanations or data visualizations</strong>. 
            Examples of queries include: 
            <em>"Which procedures have the highest write-offs?"</em> or 
            <em>"Show conversion rates for new patient inquiries this month."</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI Agent uses a <strong>Qwen-3 base model</strong> for its multilingual capabilities, 
            allowing clinics to translate campaigns and communications into languages like Spanish automatically. 
            Fine-tuning was performed on <strong>2× H100 GPUs</strong> using <strong>DeepSpeed, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), and parallel computing</strong> 
            to accelerate training and optimize performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            The backend includes a robust <strong>ETL pipeline</strong> that extracts and synchronizes structured data 
            from OpenDental and the CRM into a centralized relational database. This enables real-time CRUD operations 
            and ensures all patient and lead information is immediately up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p> When asked about <em>"Which procedures have the highest write-offs?"</em>, the agent reaponse as text was <em> "The WriteOff is calculated as: (Sum of all fees on procedures - Sum of all insurance estimates and insurance payments received) + WriteoffsAlreadySent.  It's not just a simple sum of all writeoffs.  The user can never directly edit this field, but it is possible to set it blank.  If the WriteOff value is higher than the WriteOffEst, then we show the WriteOff value in color red.  This means that it has been manually altered from the estimate. We don't currently track who changed it."</em>, and the visual response as shown below </p>

            This platform provides dental clinics with a unified view of all contacts, actionable insights for resource planning, 
            marketing, and patient management, and an intelligent assistant designed specifically for dental operations. 
            With this foundation, clinics can better understand patient needs, optimize marketing efforts, 
            and deliver higher quality care efficiently.

        <h3>Research Assistant, Frontiers of Optical Imaging and Biology Lab</h3>
        <p>
            In this research, I worked on aligning 3D eye scan datasets from humans, mice, and bovine subjects. 
            Each scan captures cellular structures at <strong>2 µm focus</strong>, where even small biological motions 
            or scanner delays cause misalignment. The goal was to dynamically correct drift while preserving the natural movement of cells.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The workflow included:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pixel classification:</strong> Identified cell bodies, nuclei, and background pixels using intensity distribution and pooling. Noise pixels were removed.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic registration:</strong> Sequentially aligned frames by tracking drift and adjusting each frame relative to the first, while allowing live cells to move naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Subject-agnostic design:</strong> The code works across different species and datasets without manual tuning.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            The registration consistently produced highly quality alignment with 97% and at  6.5 MB/s processing speed, making cellular structures clearly visible 
            in top, front, and side views, and enabling downstream analysis of cell motion and behavior.

        <h3>Consultant, EDD chat assistant</h3>

        <p>
            From August 2024 to January 2025, I worked on integrating AI into the **CEDS creation process** for under-resourced Economic Development Districts (EDDs). 
            The CEDS is a strategic plan used to drive regional economic growth and is critical for securing federal funding through the Economic Development Administration (EDA). 
            Many EDDs face challenges in creating strong CEDS documents due to limited resources, expertise, and access to data.

            <strong>Problem:</strong> Creating a robust CEDS is time-intensive and requires data analysis, stakeholder engagement, and alignment with EDA guidelines. Smaller districts often struggle to meet these requirements, delaying funding and limiting economic development opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> The project aimed to develop an AI-driven CEDS generator that leverages generative AI and transformer-based models to automate key parts of the process. Key features include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structured Input Interface:</strong> Predefined fields for entering regional data to ensure alignment with EDA guidelines.</li>
                <li><strong>LLM Integration:</strong> Large language models process inputs and generate region-specific strategies using historical CEDS data.</li>
                <li><strong>SWOT Automation:</strong> AI-assisted SWOT analyses and strategic recommendations based on regional data.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation Framework Alignment:</strong> Automated feedback to ensure generated CEDS meets EDA evaluation criteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Modular design allowing use across multiple EDDs with regional customization.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Implementation Strategy:</strong> 
            - Built a prototype integrating AI( used VLLM mistral architecture with mutiple Lora adaptors targeting different layers of base model) with SWOT analysis and draft CEDS generation.  
            - Used cosine similarity to compare generated content against approved CEDS documents, focusing on areas like climate resilience and equity.  
            - Incorporated feedback loops for planners to iteratively refine inputs and outputs.  
            - Designed front-end mockups and modular agent frameworks for user-friendly interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Impact:</strong> This project demonstrated the potential for AI to streamline CEDS creation, automate labor-intensive tasks, and improve document quality and compliance. The prototype empowered planners to create data-backed, EDA-compliant strategies more efficiently.  
            While I paused working on this project after January 2025 due to time constraints, the foundation provides a scalable framework for future AI-assisted economic development tools.

        <h3>3-Phase BLDC Wheel Hub Motor - Patent</h3>
        <p>
            This invention focuses on the design, development, and optimization of a 3-phase BLDC wheel hub motor with an inner rotor and outer stator. The motor is designed to reduce wheel size while maintaining high torque and efficiency. Key components include the stator, rotor, and Hall sensors for precise rotor position detection.
        </p>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
            The stator is constructed using laminated material to minimize eddy current losses and contains 18 slots arranged in a star winding pattern for copper coils. The **rotor** uses six high-flux Neodymium permanent magnets, chosen to maximize torque output in a compact form factor. Hall sensors are employed to synchronize stator excitation, enabling smooth rotation and efficient electronic commutation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each design parameter—pole count, slot number, coil turns, and rotor geometry—was evaluated through multiple iterative simulations, generating large datasets for performance, torque, thermal, and magnetic efficiency. I applied machine learning models to analyze these outputs, identify patterns, and predict optimal configurations for the next iteration, effectively connecting the dots between simulations and achieving highly efficient motor designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The design allows for direct integration into the wheel, eliminating the need for conventional drivetrains, gearboxes, axles, or differentials. This results in weight reduction, lower maintenance, improved vehicle dynamics, and greater interior design flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Design considerations included:
            <ul>
                <li>Inner rotor and outer stator configuration to reduce motor diameter and improve torque-to-size ratio.</li>
                <li>Iterative optimization of pole count, slot number, and coil turns for desired performance using ML-assisted analysis.</li>
                <li>Evaluation of multiple rotor core designs (curved, rectangular, perpendicular magnets) for optimal surface fit and torque efficiency.</li>
                <li>Use of cost-effective materials while ensuring high thermal performance and reliability.</li>
                <li>Minimized cogging torque and high dynamic response for fast acceleration and precise control.</li>
            </ul>

            Advantages of this motor include smaller wheel size, improved torque-to-size ratio, higher efficiency, reduced weight, and simplified drivetrain design. The motor can be used in hybrid or fully electric vehicles with small wheel rims (5.9–10 inches).
        </p>
        <p>
            Working on this project sparked my interest in data-driven engineering and ML applications in mechatronics, inspiring me to pursue a Master’s in Data Science at Indiana University. This allowed me to deepen my expertise in data analysis, predictive modeling, and optimization, and eventually join the IU Autonomous Racing Team to apply these skills to real-world autonomous vehicle systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this patent project strengthened my skills in electromechanical design, motor optimization, iterative analysis, and innovation for electric vehicle systems, while also bridging my interest in data science and autonomous technologies.

        <h3>Analyzing and Visualizing Usage for Common Coordinate Framework User Interfaces | Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            This project focused on understanding how users interact with the Registration User Interface (RUI) and Exploration User Interface (EUI) of the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), developed by Indiana University's Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center. 
            By leveraging Google Analytics data, we examined user behavior patterns, element usage frequency, and engagement with spatial search and opacity features.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project involved cleaning and preprocessing a dataset of <strong>192,271 user events</strong>, including event timestamps, page locations, and user identifiers. Critical steps included converting Unix epoch timestamps to human-readable formats, handling missing data, and ensuring data consistency for accurate analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our objectives were to:
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze frequency distributions of user events, such as clicks, mouse movements, and interactions with UI elements.</li>
                <li>Identify the most and least used interface components to understand user engagement.</li>
                <li>Quantify the frequency of opacity changes in the RUI and assess spatial search usage in the EUI.</li>
                <li>Provide insights to guide interface improvements and feature prioritization.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Visualization techniques included time series analysis to capture engagement trends, bar and pie charts to illustrate UI element usage, and histograms for opacity and spatial search events. Key insights revealed:
            <ul>
                <li>Fluctuating engagement over time, highlighting peak usage periods and optimal times for feature rollouts.</li>
                <li>High interaction with central UI elements, with underutilized features identified for refinement.</li>
                <li>Specific adoption patterns of spatial search, suggesting areas for personalized feature enhancements.</li>
                <li>Opacity adjustments in the RUI indicating user interest in visual customization, guiding future UI enhancements.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            During validation, we addressed challenges such as data complexity, event identification, missing values, and visualization clarity by:
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing sophisticated data filtering and segmentation.</li>
                <li>Standardizing timestamps and handling missing values through imputation or exclusion.</li>
                <li>Creating focused, user-centric visualizations for each analytical question.</li>
                <li>Categorizing user events with refined approaches to highlight meaningful interactions.</li>

            As the Head of Powertrain, I was responsible for the **complete design and manufacturing of the ATV’s transmission system** from scratch. This included the gearbox, CVT, drive shafts, gearbox mounting, and rear hub assembly. Key tasks involved defining tolerances, calculating loads on each structural component, designing angles, and ensuring efficient integration with the vehicle chassis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Working with a tight budget of approximately <strong>₹58,000 (~$800 USD)</strong> in 2019, we optimized costs by selectively manufacturing components in-house while strategically purchasing critical parts like drive shafts. Aluminum was chosen for several components due to its light weight and heat transfer properties, and careful design of cuts and holes helped reduce weight without compromising structural integrity. Air channeling techniques were integrated to ensure efficient cooling of critical powertrain components.
        </p>
        <p>
            Challenges included managing the mechanical design of the CVT and gearbox housings, ensuring alignment and smooth transmission of power, and maintaining performance under dynamic loads. Despite these challenges, the design performed reliably during testing and competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Achievements during the competition:
            <ul>
                <li>Ranked top team for best acceleration and braking performance.</li>
                <li>Placed top 5 in maneuverability out of 85 teams from leading Indian universities.</li>
                <li>Successfully built the university’s first functional Baja vehicle, demonstrating practical engineering, cost optimization, and innovative design solutions.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
